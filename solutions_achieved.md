2. **Highest Cost Transaction:**  
   The maximum cost in the dataset was retrieved, which revealed that recurring rent expenses were consistently high, making rent a major focus for budget review.

3. **Categorical and Temporal Analysis:**  
   Expenses were analyzed by months, categories, and companies. This analysis showed that grocery spending peaked in certain months, while restaurant expenses were consistent.

4. **Restaurant vs. Grocery Spending Insights:**

**Project Title:**  
Expense Analysis and Optimization Using Google BigQuery

**Context:**  
Efficient expense tracking is critical for individuals and organizations alike to manage budgets effectively, optimize spending, and identify cost-saving opportunities. This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive set of personal or organizational expenses using Google BigQuery. The dataset includes a wide range of transactions spanning multiple categories like rent, groceries, entertainment, and restaurants. By leveraging SQL queries on BigQuery, we aim to uncover spending trends, patterns, and insights that will aid in better financial decision-making.

**Challenges Identified:**
- **Tracking diverse spending categories:** The dataset includes multiple categories such as rent, groceries, entertainment, and more, each with varied spending patterns.
- **Comparing expenses across time periods:** Identifying monthly or seasonal fluctuations in expenses is critical to developing a clear financial strategy.
- **Identifying high-cost transactions:** Some categories or specific companies have high costs, which could point to areas for potential savings.
- **Optimizing future spending:** Understanding past trends will provide insight into where cost-cutting or budget reallocation could improve overall financial health.

**Objectives:**
1. Identify trends and patterns in the dataset based on various categories.
2. Calculate the total cost of each category and highlight areas where spending is excessive.
3. Generate actionable insights, such as the highest and lowest costs, highest expense categories, and potential savings.
4. Use advanced BigQuery features to perform complex queries and obtain deeper financial insights.
